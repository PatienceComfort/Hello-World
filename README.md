# Hello-World
This is my very first repository on GIthub. 

##### Subheader

Following a git tutorial on youtube.
Adding another line to verify the effectiveness of the public key. Hope it works!
For now something is off. But I'll figure it out. I guess the order of my commands are a bit out of wack

Correct order:
- git status
- git add .
- git status (to check if the changes have been tracked)
- git commit -m "Message title" -m "Message text"
- git push / git push origin master

I still dont understand what "git push origin master" is meant for. When I enter this command, It tells me that "Everything is up-to-date" but it doesn't push any of the chages onto my online repo. Unless I go through the regular status, add, commit first. So basically does the same thing as "git push"
